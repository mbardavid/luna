# BUY_GUIDE (short)

## When paid tools are worth it
- **High-volume cleanup (50+ tiles/week):** Adobe Illustrator (Image Trace + Shape Builder + global swatches) saves many hours.
- **Museum-grade restoration:** hire a specialist vectorizer when historical fidelity is critical.
- **Production color management:** Affinity Designer/Illustrator with Pantone libraries and print proof workflows.

## Cheapest practical path (exact)
1. **Primary workflow (cheapest):** Inkscape (free) + Python/OpenCV (free) + Krita/GIMP (free) for reference prep.
2. **One-time paid boost (optional):** Affinity Designer one-time license (often ~€70, no subscription) for faster node cleanup and export presets.
3. **Only if needed:** 1 month Illustrator subscription for bulk jobs, then cancel.

## Rule of thumb
- 1–10 patterns: stay free/open-source.
- 10–100 patterns with deadlines: one-time Affinity license is best value.
- Enterprise pipeline or strict prepress compliance: Illustrator subscription may justify cost.
