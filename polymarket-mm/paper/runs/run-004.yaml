# Run 004 — H1: Lucratividade (fix SELL position sync)
# Fix: venue now allows SELL YES when holding position (was rejecting with held=0)
#       - SELL with full position → proceeds normally
#       - SELL larger than held → resized to held qty
#       - SELL with 0 position → complement routing (BUY opposite token)
