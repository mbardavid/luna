# P5 Paper Trading — Post-Production Calibration
# Incorporates all learnings from prod-001 (98.6% SELL rejections) 
# and prod-002 (balance exhaustion after initial fills)
#
# Key findings to address:
# 1. $25 capital exhausted quickly — need better position sizing
# 2. Complement routing works but doubles capital usage (BUY on both sides)
# 3. Fill rate effectively 0% once capital depleted
# 4. Need: position cap enforcement, capital recycling, balance-aware quoting

changes_from_parent: |
  - Paper mode (not production)
  - Balance-aware quoting: skip if balance < min_balance_to_quote
  - Position recycling: close winning positions to free capital
  - Wider spread (40 vs 30 bps) for more conservative approach
  - Larger order size (10 vs 5) with higher initial balance
  - Adversarial fill model (15% fill rate, 15bps adverse selection)
