# Run 005 — H1: Lucratividade (fix complement routing + kill switch threshold)
# Fix 1: Disable complement routing in paper (was causing double exposure)
#         - SELL with 0 position → REJECTED (not complement-routed)
#         - SELL with partial position → resized to held qty (unchanged)
# Fix 2: Kill switch threshold 10% → 25%, alert at 15%
